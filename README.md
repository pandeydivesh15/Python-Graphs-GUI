# Python-Graphs-GUI
An attempt to create interactive GUI for my python graphs

## Introduction
- Aiming to create a **Electron / React / Dash** based GUI which can handle my python graphs. Currently, all my python graphs are made in Jupyter.
- Ideally, will like to separate out the graph construction logic so that any other repo too can reuse the GUI part (one IN-PROGRESS private trading related repo for me)
